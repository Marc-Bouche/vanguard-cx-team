# Vanguard Customer Team

## Description
#### Context
You are a newly employed data analyst in the Customer Experience (CX) team at Vanguard, the US-based investment management company.</br>
You’ve been thrown straight into the deep end with your first task. Before your arrival, the team launched an exciting digital experiment, and now, they’re eagerly waiting to uncover the results and need your help.</br>

#### The Digital Challenge
The digital world is evolving, and so are Vanguard’s clients. Vanguard believed that a more intuitive and modern User Interface (UI), coupled with timely in-context prompts (cues, messages, hints, or instructions provided to users directly within the context of their current task or action), could make the online process smoother for clients. The critical question was:</br>
Would these changes encourage more clients to complete the process?</br>
